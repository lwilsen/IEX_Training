# LLM PAGE
---
This folder uses the Cohere command-r-plus large language model to check for bugs in python code, and to predict the sentiment of IMDB movie reviews. This "project" was mostly done to get experience interacting with LLM's through api's and using a model for classification purposes.

My streamlit app can be run using the command: "streamlit run assistant_app.py"

You'll be able to input python code, it will check it for bugs!

Example Below:

This streamlit app was made using the command-r-plus Cohere Model (https://docs.cohere.com/docs/models)

# Titanic ML Exploration Project

The goal of this project was to predict the survival outcome of passengers on the titanic based on data from this Kaggle dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data.

## Project Overview

### Variables Used

Below is a table of which variables I used to train my models, and a description of what they are.

### Model Evaluation Methods

I also wanted to highlight my use of Learning Curves and ROC graphs to evaluate the accuracy of my model, while also looking at different metrics like specificity and sensitivity.

## Project Overview

### Variables Used

Below is a table of which variables I used to train my models, and a description of what they are.

### Models

I used a couple of different models, and after hyper parameter tuning, I got the following models and associated scores.

### Model Evaluation Methods

I also wanted to highlight my use of Learning Curves and ROC graphs to evaluate the accuracy of my model, while also looking at different metrics like specificity and sensitivity.

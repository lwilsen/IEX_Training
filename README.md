# IEX_Training

Welcome to my first training repo! This is a very basic, (and messy) repo used for the purpose of familiarizing myself with how git works! Check out my other repo's for some examples of some better organization.

This repo is divided into different topics that I learned about as a part of my internship with IEX (Iron Eagle X). The culmination of the first part of the internship is located in the final project, and consists of a docker compose that creates, hosts and runs a database, flask backend, and streamlit frontend!

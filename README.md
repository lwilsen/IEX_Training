# IEX_Training

Welcome to my first training repo! This is a very basic, (and messy but soon to be organized!) repo used for the purpose of familiarizing myself with how git works! Check out my other repo's for some examples of some better organization.

This repo is divided into different topics that I learned about as a part of my internship with IEX (Iron Eagle X).

## Topics
1. Large Language Models (Cohere) Functionalized in a Streamlit App.
2. Linear and Logistic Regression for Prediction.
3. Natural Language Processing for Sentiment Analysis.
4. Neural Networks for Image Classification of Handwritten Digits (MNIST).
5. Streamlit App Development
6. Titanic Survival Predictions
    - Initial Project
    - Ensemble Techniques
    - Dockerized version (work in progress)
7. Sqlite Training

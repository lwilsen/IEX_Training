st.markdown("""
The MNIST dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It stands for **Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology** database and contains a large collection of handwritten digits. Each image in the dataset is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image, depicting a single digit from 0 to 9.

### Key Features of the MNIST Dataset:
- **Training Set**: 60,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Test Set**: 10,000 images of handwritten digits.
- **Image Size**: 28x28 pixels.
- **Grayscale**: Each pixel is represented by a grayscale value ranging from 0 (black) to 255 (white).

### Common Uses:
1. **Neural Network Training**: Given its simplicity and the large number of examples, the MNIST dataset is ideal for training and testing neural networks, especially for those new to deep learning. It helps in understanding the workings of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and other related architectures.

2. **Benchmarking Algorithms**: The MNIST dataset is widely used to benchmark and compare the performance of various machine learning algorithms. It serves as a standard for evaluating the effectiveness of new algorithms and techniques in image recognition.

3. **Feature Extraction and Dimensionality Reduction**: Researchers use the MNIST dataset to explore feature extraction methods and dimensionality reduction techniques, such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE).

4. **Educational Purposes**: Due to its simplicity and accessibility, the MNIST dataset is frequently used in educational settings to teach students about the fundamentals of machine learning and image processing.

### How Itâ€™s Used in this Streamlit App:
In our Streamlit app, we leverage the MNIST dataset to demonstrate the process of building, training, and evaluating a neural network model. The app includes visualizations of the dataset, two different neural networks (one PyTorch model and one TensorFlow model), and displaying the performance metrics.

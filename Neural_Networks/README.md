# Neural Networks

This repository is home to my Neural Network learning. A lot of what I learned came from the "Machine Learning with PyTorch and Scikit-Learn" (Raschka et al., 2022) (https://www.google.com/books/edition/Machine_Learning_with_PyTorch_and_Scikit/SVxaEAAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=0)
As such, most of this work was done with PyTorch.

 ### Methods/Topics:
 - Learning Linear Regression params 
 - Multilayer Perceptron for IRIS dataset classification 
  - Exploration of Activation function
- XOR classification problem
- MNIST classification (PyTorch, TensorFlow)
- Predicting Fuel Efficiency of Cars

### MNIST Prediction App
This streamlit app compares the performance of the same NN created using Pytorch vs Tensorflow.
